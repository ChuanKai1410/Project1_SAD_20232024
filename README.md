## Introduction
----
Restaurant Management System (RMS) are becoming indispensable tools in current‚Äôs restaurant business for improving client experiences and optimizing operations. However, plenty of restaurants, for instance Siao Sheng Ya, are having problems with their existing RMS.

In addition to this, processing payments and entering orders by hand at the counter causes inefficiencies and service delays. Due to its restricted capabilities, the restaurant is unable to effectively compete in the market and adapt to changing client needs. 

Mr. Kiho intends to improve the current RMS to better serve the demands of the restaurant‚Äôs patrons in order to address these issues. In order to maintain its competitive edge in the fast-paced restaurants sector of nowadays, Mr. Kiho is modernizing its system to incorporate enhanced reservation capabilities, delivery management and online payment choices. 


## Background Study
---
Currently, Siao Sheng Ya restaurant relies on a basic restaurant management system (RMS) to handle its daily operations, encompassing food ordering, menu display, and pick-up services for dining in or takeout orders. Despite its reputation for delectable cuisine, the restaurant grapples with inefficiencies in delivery management, reservation capabilities, and payment methods. Mr. Kiho, the proprietor, has turned to DineDart.com, a robust platform, to optimize his operations and enhance customer service.

Additionally, Mr. Kiho has observed a significant number of students and low-income families patronizing his establishment. Recognizing the need to cater to their needs, he contemplates offering a dedicated menu tailored to their preferences, aiming to provide a welcoming atmosphere for all patrons. In the fiercely competitive restaurant industry, customer satisfaction is paramount. However, Siao Sheng Ya faces challenges in delivering seamless dining experiences and promptly addressing customer inquiries.

The current pick-up service falls short of meeting service standards and fostering customer loyalty. Moreover, the limited payment options, particularly the requirement to pay at the counter, result in long queues and inconvenience for customers. The absence of a reservation system further compounds the issue, forcing patrons to wait in line, leading to frustration and potential loss of business.

To address these challenges, Siao Sheng Ya seeks to digitize key operational processes, including delivery management, payment processing, catering menus, and reservation capabilities. By leveraging the capabilities of DineDart.com, the restaurant aims to streamline operations, enhance service efficiency, and elevate the overall dining experience for its customers. Through innovative technology and seamless integration, Siao Sheng Ya endeavors to delight customers and achieve excellence in its business operations.
