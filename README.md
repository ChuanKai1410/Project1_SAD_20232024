Currently, Siao Sheng Ya restaurant relies on a basic restaurant management system (RMS) to handle its daily operations, encompassing food ordering, menu display, and pick-up services for dining in or takeout orders. Despite its reputation for delectable cuisine, the restaurant grapples with inefficiencies in delivery management, reservation capabilities, and payment methods.

Additionally, Mr. Kiho has observed a significant number of students and low-income families patronizing his establishment.
